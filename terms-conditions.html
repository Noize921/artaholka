                <h3>1. Welcome to Artaholka!</h3>
                <p class="overall"> This page explains our terms of use. When you use Artaholka, you’re agreeing to all
                    the rules on
                    this page. Some of them need to be expressed in legal language, but we’ve done our best to offer
                    you clear and simple explanations of what everything means — hence the brief summaries in these
                    blue boxes. The summaries, for the record, are not part of the official legal terms.</p>

                <p>Welcome to Artaholka. By using this website (the “Site”) and services (together with the Site,
                    the “Services”) offered by Artaholka, PBC (together with Drip U.S., LLC, The Creative
                    Independent, LLC, and its and their parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives,
                    consultants, employees, officers, and directors — collectively, “Artaholka,” “we,” or “us”),
                    you’re agreeing to these legally binding rules (the “Terms”). You’re also agreeing to our Privacy
                    Policy and Cookie Policy, and agreeing to follow any other rules on the Site, like our Community
                    Guidelines and rules for starting projects.</p>

                <p>We may change these terms from time to time. If we do, we’ll let you know about any material
                    changes, either by notifying you on the Site or by sending you an email. New versions of the terms
                    will never apply retroactively — we’ll tell you the exact date they go into effect. If you keep
                    using Artaholka after a change, that means you accept the new terms.</p>

                <h3>2. About Creating an Account</h3>
                <p class="overall"> To sign up for a Artaholka account, you need to be 18 or over. You’re responsible
                    for your
                    account and all the activity on it. </p>

                <p>You can browse Artaholka without registering for an account. But to use some of Artaholka’s
                    functions, you’ll need to register, choose a username, and set a password. When you do that, the
                    information you give us has to be accurate and complete. Don’t impersonate anyone else or choose
                    names that are offensive or that violate anyone’s rights. If you don’t follow these rules, we may
                    cancel your account. </p>

                <p>You’re responsible for all the activity on your account, and for keeping your password confidential.
                    If you find out that someone’s used your account without your permission, you should report it to
                    support@Artaholka.com.</p>

                <p>To sign up for an account, you need to be at least 18 years old, or old enough to form a binding
                    contract where you live. If necessary, we may ask you for proof of age.</p>

                <h3>3. Things You Definitely Shouldn’t Do</h3>
                <p class="overall"> This section is a list of things you probably already know you shouldn’t do — lie,
                    break laws,
                    abuse people, steal data, hack other people’s computers, and so on. Please behave yourself. Don’t
                    do this stuff. </p>

                <p>Millions of people use Artaholka. We expect all of them to behave responsibly and help keep this a
                    nice place. Don’t do any of these things on the Site: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t break the law. Don’t take any action that infringes or violates other people’s rights,
                        violates the law, or breaches any contract or legal duty you have toward anyone. </li>
                    <li>Don’t lie to people. Don’t post information you know is false, misleading, or inaccurate. Don’t
                        do anything deceptive or fraudulent. </li>
                    <li>Don’t offer prohibited items. Don’t offer any rewards that are illegal, violate any of
                        Artaholka’s policies, rules, or guidelines, or violate any applicable law, statute,
                        ordinance, or regulation. </li>
                    <li>Don’t victimize anyone. Don’t do anything threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory,
                        libelous, tortious, obscene, profane, or invasive of another person’s privacy.</li>
                    <li>Don’t spam. Don’t distribute unsolicited or unauthorized advertising or promotional material,
                        or any junk mail, spam, or chain letters. Don’t run mail lists, listservs, or any kind of
                        auto-responder or spam on or through the Site. </li>
                    <li>Don’t harm anyone’s computer. Don’t distribute software viruses, or anything else (code, films,
                        programs) designed to interfere with the proper function of any software, hardware, or
                        equipment on the Site (whether it belongs to Artaholka or another party). </li>
                    <li>Don’t abuse other users’ personal information. When you use Artaholka — and especially if you
                        create a successful project — you may receive information about other users, including things
                        like their names, email addresses, and postal addresses. This information is provided for the
                        purpose of participating in a Artaholka project: don’t use it for other purposes, and don’t
                        abuse it. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>We also need to make sure that the Site is secure and our systems function properly. So don’t do any
                    of these things — most of which boil down to “don’t mess with our system.” </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t try to interfere with the proper workings of the Services.</li>
                    <li>Don’t bypass any measures we’ve put in place to secure the Services.</li>
                    <li>Don’t try to damage or get unauthorized access to any system, data, password, or other
                        information, whether it belongs to Artaholka or another party.</li>
                    <li>Don’t take any action that imposes an unreasonable load on our infrastructure, or on our
                        third-party providers. (We reserve the right to determine what’s reasonable.)</li>
                    <li>Don’t use any kind of software or device (whether it’s manual or automated) to “crawl” or
                        “spider” any part of the Site.</li>
                    <li>Don’t take apart or reverse engineer any aspect of Artaholka in an effort to access things
                        like source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms.</li>

                <h3>4. How Projects Work</h3>
                <p class="overall">Most of our Terms of Use explain your relationship with Artaholka. This section is
                    different — it
                    explains the relationship between creators and backers of Artaholka projects, and who’s
                    responsible for what. This is what you’re agreeing to when you create or back a Artaholka
                    project. </p>

                <p>Artaholka provides a funding platform for creative projects. When a creator posts a project on
                    Artaholka, they’re inviting other people to form a contract with them. Anyone who backs a project
                    is accepting the creator’s offer, and forming that contract. </p>

                <p>Artaholka is not a part of this contract — the contract is a direct legal agreement between
                    creators and their backers. Here are the terms that govern that agreement: </p>

                <p>When a project is successfully funded, the creator must complete the project and fulfill each
                    reward. Once a creator has done so, they’ve satisfied their obligation to their backers. </p>

                <p>Throughout the process, creators owe their backers a high standard of effort, honest communication,
                    and a dedication to bringing the project to life. At the same time, backers must understand that
                    when they back a project, they’re helping to create something new — not ordering something that
                    already exists. There may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that
                    prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as promised. </p>

                <p>If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards, they’ve failed to live up to
                    the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to
                    find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for backers. A creator in
                    this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what
                        prevents them from finishing the project as planned;</li>
                    <li>they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in
                        a timeframe that’s communicated to backers;</li>
                    <li>they’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable
                        effort to complete the project as promised;</li>
                    <li>they’ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to
                        backers; and</li>
                    <li>they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in
                        proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete
                        the project in some alternate form.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If they’re
                    unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers. </p>

                <h3>9. Our Rights</h3>
                <p class="overall">To operate, we need to be able to maintain control over what happens on our website.
                    So in this section, we reserve the right to make decisions to protect the health and integrity of
                    our system. We don’t take these powers lightly, and we only use them when we absolutely have to.
                </p>

                <p>Artaholka reserves these rights: </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We can make changes to the Artaholka Site and Services without notice or liability.</li>
                    <li>We have the right to decide who’s eligible to use Artaholka. We can cancel accounts or
                        decline to offer our Services. (Especially if you’re abusing them.) We can change our
                        eligibility criteria at any time. If these things are prohibited by law where you live, then we
                        revoke your right to use Artaholka in that jurisdiction.</li>
                    <li>We have the right to cancel any pledge to any project, at any time and for any reason.</li>
                    <li>We have the right to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend any project at any time and
                        for any reason.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Artaholka is not liable for any damages as a result of any of these actions, and it is our policy
                    not to comment on the reasons for any such action. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h3>10. Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
                <p class="overall">We work hard to provide you with great services, but we can’t guarantee everything
                    will always work perfectly. This site is presented as-is, without warranties. </p>

                <p>You use our Services solely at your own risk. They are provided to you “as is” and “as available”
                    and without warranty of any kind, express or implied. </p>

                <p>Artaholka SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY,
                    NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY ANY COURSE OF
                    DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION (ORAL OR WRITTEN)
                    OBTAINED BY YOU FROM Artaholka SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY. </p>

                <h3>11. The Rest</h3>
                <p class="overall">These are our official terms and our rules for how things work. (So if you ever see confusing or conflicting information about any of this stuff, just check these terms — they’re the last word.) Thanks so much for reading them, and for using Artaholka! </p>

                <p>These Terms and the other material referenced in them are the entire agreement between you and Artaholka with respect to the Services. They supersede all other communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and Artaholka with respect to the Services and govern our future relationship. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid under the law, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms otherwise will remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either you or Artaholka to exercise any right provided for in these Terms in any way won’t be deemed a waiver of any other rights. </p>

                <p>These Terms are personal to you. You can’t assign them, transfer them, or sublicense them unless you get Artaholka’s prior written consent. Artaholka has the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations under these Terms without your consent. Artaholka will provide you notice via email, written notice, or by conspicuously posting the notice on our Site. </p>
